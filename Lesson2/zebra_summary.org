#+TITLE: How to solve a problem in python

* Approach
1. Concept inventory
2. Refine ideas
3. Simple implemention
4. Back envolope (About how long it will take)
5. Refine code (Make it faster if need)
* Idea of building tools
1. Timing
2. Counts
* Separation of aspects
Make Computer design as clean as possible
by separate the codes in three different parts

1. Correct
2. Efficient
3. Debug

So that you can tell what was working on making the problem right
and what was working on making it more efficient
